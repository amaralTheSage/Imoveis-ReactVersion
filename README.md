College project:

Techs: ReactJS with TypeScript, TailwindCSS;

Design (Figma) and code made by me.

Responsive property selling/renting website which would work simply as a way for property owners and possible buyers/renters to find each other, link up, and negotiate.
The app is front-end only, and works like this:

The user can login into an account (simulated, there's no registering system);
When logged in, they get to publish properties that will then await approval by an admin;
The user can then login into the admin account (email: admin@gmail.com, password: admin);
When acting as an admin, they get access to a property review page, where they can approve of their own properties' publishing;
When approved, properties will be saved to the local storage and will show up on the main page.

ps: I pushed some changes to the repo from a PC at college and turns out another account was logged in so now this guy is forever listed as a contributor lol
